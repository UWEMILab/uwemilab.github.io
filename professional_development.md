 ## Professional Development
---

<h2>Professional Development</h2>

Our group believes that a foundational education is one that is strong in education and professional development. At the University of Washington, we are fortunate to have access to a number of professional activities outside the laboratory. We believe that each EMI Lab student can specialize in research *AND* one, or any of the following.

#### Extracurricular Activities

As part of an immersive student experience, many of our group members are heavily involved in student organizations at the University of Washington. We understand that part of being a well-rounded professional also includes becoming leaders within among our own community. All of our members have served as leaders in UW's Association of Chemical Engineering Graduate Students (ACES), Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS), Women in Chemical Engineering (WChE), and the UW Student Chapter of the Electrochemical Society (ECS). Our members have helped our student body by organizing events like the Chemical Engineering Graduate Student Symposium, and Industry Panel events.

#### Data Science  

With the growing amount of data being generated, many of our students participate in the DIRECT Program, where they gain critical skills in data science and software carpentry to advance their own research in the clean energy sector. Given the resources and expertise fostered here at the University of Washington, the EMI Lab pushed for the Electrochemical Society to host ECS Hackweeks at the bi-annual conference, which are week-long, immersive workshops that include Python tutorials and collaborative projects. As part of our push for data science research, our group sends students to be leaders at these conferences as course instructors and project pioneers.
