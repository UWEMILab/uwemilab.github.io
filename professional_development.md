## Professional Development

Our group believes that a foundational education is one that is strong in education and professional development. At the University of Washington, we are fortunate to have access to a number of professional activities outside the laboratory. We believe that each EMI Lab student can specialize in research *AND* one, or any of the following.

#### Data Science  

With the growing amount of data being generated, many of our students participate in the DIRECT Program, where they gain critical skills in data science and programming to advance their own research in the clean energy sector. Given the resources and expertise fostered here at the University of Washington, the EMI Lab pushed for the Electrochemical Society to host ECS Hackweeks, which are week-long, immersive data science Hack Weeks at the bi-annual conference. As part of our push for data science research, our group sends students to be leaders at these conferences as course instructors and project pioneers.
