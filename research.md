Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a commonly used tool to help probe noninvasively probe physicochemical and degradative processes in lithium-ion batteries. Given the same hardware and equipment, a nonlinear extension could be used to gain more sensitive, information-rich signals in the form of the second-harmonic response. These responses, when analyzed in conjunction with a sophisticated physics-based model, can be used to determine changes batteries at different states-of-charge or states-of-health that previously were invisible in traditional EIS.

#### POWER HARDWARE IN THE LOOP
![HILLP](/images/HILLP.jpg){: style="float: right"}{:width="550px"}

Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation allows real-world tests for cells to battery packs available at a lower cost with high reproducibility by setting a virtual test bench operating in real-time. This simulation-based research will allow real-time prediction on the possible power output of battery packs at different life stages which will be used to predict the feasibility of different battery pack models.
