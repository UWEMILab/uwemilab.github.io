Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a commonly used tool to help probe noninvasively probe physicochemical and degradative processes in lithium-ion batteries. Given the same hardware and equipment, a nonlinear extension could be used to gain more sensitive, information-rich signals in the form of the second-harmonic response. These responses, when analyzed in conjunction with a sophisticated physics-based model, can be used to determine changes batteries at different states-of-charge or states-of-health that previously were invisible in traditional EIS.
